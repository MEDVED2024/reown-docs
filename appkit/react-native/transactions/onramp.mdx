title: On-Ramp
---

Enable users to purchase crypto with fiat directly within your React Native app using AppKit's On-Ramp feature. This integration allows users to securely access over 100 cryptocurrencies and purchase tokens to support in-app activity and transactions across multiple chains.

## Configuration

The On-Ramp feature is enabled by default in AppKit. Here's how to configure it in your app:

```typescript
import { createAppKit } from '@reown/appkit...';

createAppKit({
  projectId: 'YOUR_PROJECT_ID',
  // ... other config options
  features: {
    onramp: true, // Optional - true by default
  }
});
```

If you want to disable the On-Ramp feature, you can set `onramp: false` in the features configuration.

## Usage

### Opening the On-Ramp View

You can programmatically open the On-Ramp view using the `useAppKit` hook:

```typescript
import { useAppKit } from '@reown/appkit...';

function BuyButton() {
  const { open } = useAppKit();

  const handleBuyPress = () => {
    open({ view: 'OnRamp' });
  };

  return (
    <Button 
      title="Buy Crypto" 
      onPress={handleBuyPress} 
    />
  );
}
```

### User Flow

1. When users tap the "Buy Crypto" button or select it from the account view, they'll be presented with available On-Ramp interface where they can:
   - Select the cryptocurrency they want to purchase
   - Select the country and fiat currency
   - Choose the amount
   - Select their preferred payment method

2. After reviewing the purchase details, the user will be redirected to the browser to finish the transaction.

3. Once the purchase is complete, the crypto will be sent directly to their connected wallet address.
